# Mobilenetv2 Ensemble for Cervical Precancerous Lesions Classification

This framework is based on an ensemble of Mobilenetv2 neural networks. It classifies colposcopy images according to the severity of the cervical lesions. 

Everything has been developed as Jupyter notebooks using Python and PyTorch frameworks. The files having tar extensions represent neural network checkpoints. Those can be loaded in other applications. Please check the source code for examples of how to load the checkpoints.
